# Project_analysis: Visual design

For this CV’s visual design, I made a series of choices focused on organization, clarity, and a modern, professional style. The goal was to make the document easy to read while effectively highlighting the candidate's strengths.

I chose a color scheme of brown and beige tones to create a serious, professional feel that also conveys warmth, making the CV visually appealing without being overwhelming. The candidate's name stands out in large white font against a brown background, creating a clear contrast that immediately identifies the document as a personal resume.

The layout is organized into two columns to maximize available space. The left column focuses on essential sections such as Professional Objectives, Academic History, and Work Experience. Meanwhile, the narrower right column contains Contact Information, Languages, Strengths, and Programming Languages, grouping complementary information in a way that enhances readability and flow.

Finally, section headers are styled in a larger, brown-colored font to distinguish each part of the document, making it easy to scan. Generous white space between sections provides a clean and uncluttered reading experience, ensuring that each section stands out clearly.
